// Code adapted from Ratas implementation, which is MIT Licensed.
// https://github.com/jsnell/ratas/blob/master/src/timer-wheel.h
//
// It has been modified to remove the MemberTimerEvent and schedule_in_range,
// neither of which we need. Additionally, we support callbacks that aren't
// just std::function<void()>.
//
// The exact implementation strategy is a hierarchical timer
// wheel. A timer wheel is effectively a ring buffer of linked lists
// of events, and a pointer to the ring buffer. As the time advances,
// the pointer moves forward, and any events in the ring buffer slots
// that the pointer passed will get executed.
//
// A hierarchical timer wheel layers multiple timer wheels running at
// different resolutions on top of each other. When an event is
// scheduled so far in the future that it does not fit the innermost
// (core) wheel, it instead gets scheduled on one of the outer
// wheels. On each rotation of the inner wheel, one slot's worth of
// events are promoted from the second wheel to the core. On each
// rotation of the second wheel, one slot's worth of events is
// promoted from the third wheel to the second, and so on.
//
// The basic usage is to create a single TimerWheel object and
// multiple TimerEvents The events are scheduled for execution using
// TimerWheel::Schedule() or unscheduled using the event's Cancel() method.
//
// It is important to note that the TimerWheel does *NOT* own its TimerEvents,
// and should not be used to manage their lifetime.
